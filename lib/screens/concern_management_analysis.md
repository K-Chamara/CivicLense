# Concern Management System - Deep Analysis & Improvement Plan

## Current System Analysis

### 1. Data Flow
```
Citizen → RaiseConcernScreen → ConcernService → Firestore
                ↓
        Sentiment Analysis → Auto Priority Assignment
                ↓
        Anti-Corruption Officer → ConcernManagementScreen → Status Updates
                ↓
        Community Engagement → Voting, Comments, Support
```
