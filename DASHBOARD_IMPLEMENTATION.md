# CivicLense Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented separate dashboards for each user role in the CivicLense application. Each user now gets a unique, role-specific dashboard when they log in.

## Implemented Dashboards

### 1. Admin Dashboard (`AdminDashboardScreen`)
- **Route**: `/admin-dashboard`
- **Color Theme**: Blue
- **Features**:
  - User management (create, edit, delete users)
  - System statistics
  - Government user creation
  - User status management
  - Professional admin interface

### 2. Finance Officer Dashboard (`FinanceOfficerDashboardScreen`)
- **Route**: `/finance-dashboard`
- **Color Theme**: Green
- **Features**:
  - Budget management tools
  - Financial reports generation
  - Expense tracking
  - Audit management
  - Vendor payments
  - Financial analytics
  - Quick stats (Total Budget, Expenses, Remaining, Pending)

### 3. Procurement Officer Dashboard (`ProcurementOfficerDashboardScreen`)
- **Route**: `/procurement-dashboard`
- **Color Theme**: Orange
- **Features**:
  - Tender management
  - Vendor management
  - Purchase orders
  - Contract management
  - Bid evaluation
  - Procurement analytics
  - Active tenders display
  - Quick stats (Active Tenders, Vendors, Contracts, Pending)

### 4. Anti-corruption Officer Dashboard (`AntiCorruptionOfficerDashboardScreen`)
- **Route**: `/anticorruption-dashboard`
- **Color Theme**: Purple
- **Features**:
  - Concern management
  - Investigation tools
  - Compliance monitoring
  - Reporting system
  - Case management
  - Whistleblower portal
  - Recent concerns display
  - Quick stats (Active Cases, Resolved, Under Review, Priority)

### 5. Public User Dashboard (`PublicUserDashboardScreen`)
- **Route**: `/public-dashboard`
- **Color Theme**: Dynamic (based on user role)
- **Features**:
  - Role-specific tools for each public user type:
    - **Citizen**: Track public spending, raise concerns, view reports
    - **Journalist**: Publish reports, media hub, news feed
    - **Community Leader**: Community management, organize events, engagement tools
    - **Researcher**: Research data, generate reports, academic tools
    - **NGO**: Project management, contractor tools, performance tracking
  - Common features for all public users
  - Recent activities tracking

## Routing Logic

The routing is implemented in `lib/main.dart` in the `_getDashboardForUser()` method:

```dart
Future<Widget> _getDashboardForUser(String uid) async {
  try {
    final adminService = AdminService();
    final isAdmin = await adminService.isAdmin(uid);
    
    if (isAdmin) {
      return const AdminDashboardScreen();
    }
    
    // Get user data from Firestore
    final userDoc = await FirebaseFirestore.instance
        .collection('users')
        .doc(uid)
        .get();
    
    if (userDoc.exists) {
      final userData = userDoc.data()!;
      final role = userData['role'];
      
      if (role != null) {
        final roleId = role['id'];
        
        // Route to specific dashboard based on role
        switch (roleId) {
          case 'finance_officer':
            return const FinanceOfficerDashboardScreen();
          case 'procurement_officer':
            return const ProcurementOfficerDashboardScreen();
          case 'anticorruption_officer':
            return const AntiCorruptionOfficerDashboardScreen();
          case 'citizen':
          case 'journalist':
          case 'community_leader':
          case 'researcher':
          case 'ngo':
            return const PublicUserDashboardScreen();
          default:
            return const DashboardScreen();
        }
      }
    }
    
    return const DashboardScreen();
  } catch (e) {
    return const DashboardScreen();
  }
}
```

## Key Features of Each Dashboard

### Common Features Across All Dashboards:
1. **Welcome Card**: Personalized greeting with user's name and role
2. **Sign Out**: Consistent logout functionality
3. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes
6. **Role-based Theming**: Each dashboard has its own color scheme

### Unique Features:
- **Admin**: Full user management capabilities
- **Finance Officer**: Financial tools and budget tracking
- **Procurement Officer**: Tender and vendor management
- **Anti-corruption Officer**: Investigation and compliance tools
- **Public Users**: Role-specific tools with common transparency features

## File Structure

```
lib/screens/
├── admin_dashboard_screen.dart (existing)
├── finance_officer_dashboard_screen.dart (new)
├── procurement_officer_dashboard_screen.dart (new)
├── anticorruption_officer_dashboard_screen.dart (new)
├── public_user_dashboard_screen.dart (new)
└── dashboard_screen.dart (existing - fallback)
```

## How It Works

1. **User Login**: When a user logs in, the app checks their role from Firestore
2. **Role Detection**: Based on the role ID, the app routes to the appropriate dashboard
3. **Dashboard Display**: Each dashboard shows role-specific features and tools
4. **Fallback**: If a role is not recognized, users are directed to the default dashboard

## Testing

To test the different dashboards:

1. **Admin**: Login with admin credentials
2. **Finance Officer**: Create a finance officer user through admin dashboard
3. **Procurement Officer**: Create a procurement officer user through admin dashboard
4. **Anti-corruption Officer**: Create an anti-corruption officer user through admin dashboard
5. **Public Users**: Register as any public user type (citizen, journalist, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

Each dashboard is designed to be extensible. You can easily add:
- More role-specific features
- Additional statistics and analytics
- Integration with external systems
- Advanced reporting capabilities
- Real-time notifications
- Mobile-specific features

## Notes

- All existing login functionality remains intact
- The original `DashboardScreen` is preserved as a fallback
- Each dashboard maintains the same authentication and user management flow
- The implementation is backward compatible
- All dashboards follow Material Design principles
- The code is well-structured and maintainable
