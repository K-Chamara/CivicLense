# CSV Upload Implementation for Budget Management

## Overview
The budget upload functionality has been successfully updated to support CSV file uploads in addition to Excel files. This change makes the system more flexible and user-friendly, as CSV files are easier to create and edit in standard spreadsheet applications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Budget Service Updates (`lib/services/budget_service.dart`)

#### New Methods Added:
- **`uploadCSVBudget(List<int> bytes)`**: Processes CSV files and extracts budget categories
- **`uploadBudgetFile(List<int> bytes, String fileName)`**: Universal method that automatically detects file type and routes to appropriate processor
- **`parseCSVLine(String line)`**: Helper method for robust CSV parsing with quoted field support

#### Key Features:
- **Automatic File Type Detection**: The system now automatically detects whether a file is CSV or Excel based on the file extension
- **Robust CSV Parsing**: Handles quoted fields, commas within descriptions, and empty lines
- **Data Validation**: Same validation rules apply to both CSV and Excel files
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages

### 2. Budget Upload Screen Updates (`lib/screens/budget_upload_screen.dart`)

#### UI Changes:
- **Header Text**: Updated from "Upload Excel files" to "Upload CSV or Excel files"
- **Section Title**: Changed from "Excel Upload" to "File Upload"
- **File Picker**: Now accepts `.csv`, `.xlsx`, and `.xls` files
- **Format Requirements**: Updated to show support for both CSV and Excel formats

#### Method Updates:
- **`_pickFile()`**: Replaces `_pickExcelFile()` and accepts CSV files
- **`_uploadFile()`**: Replaces `_uploadExcelFile()` and uses the universal upload method
- **`_testFileProcessing()`**: Replaces `_testExcelProcessing()` for testing both formats

### 3. Dashboard Updates (`lib/screens/budget_dashboard_screen.dart`)

#### Quick Actions:
- **Button Text**: Changed from "Upload Excel" to "Upload File"
- **Description**: Updated to "Import budget from CSV or Excel file"

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### README (`BUDGET_MANAGEMENT_README.md`):
- **Features Section**: Updated to reflect CSV as primary format
- **File Format Requirements**: Added CSV format examples
- **Supported File Types**: CSV now listed as primary format
- **Troubleshooting**: Updated section titles to reflect general file support

## Technical Implementation Details

### CSV Parsing Algorithm:
1. **File Reading**: Converts file bytes to UTF-8 string
2. **Line Processing**: Splits by newlines and processes each row
3. **Field Extraction**: Uses custom parser to handle quoted fields and commas
4. **Data Validation**: Ensures required fields are present and amounts are valid
5. **Category Creation**: Creates BudgetCategory objects with proper data types

### File Type Detection:
```dart
final extension = fileName.split('.').last.toLowerCase();
switch (extension) {
  case 'csv':
    return await uploadCSVBudget(bytes);
  case 'xlsx':
  case 'xls':
    return await uploadExcelBudget(bytes);
  default:
    throw Exception('Unsupported file format...');
}
```

### CSV Field Parsing:
- **Column A**: Category Name (required)
- **Column B**: Description (optional)
- **Column C**: Allocated Amount (required, numeric)

## Benefits of CSV Support

### 1. **Easier File Creation**:
- CSV files can be created in any text editor
- Standard spreadsheet applications (Google Sheets, Excel, Numbers) can export to CSV
- No need for specialized Excel software

### 2. **Better Compatibility**:
- CSV is a universal format supported by all platforms
- Smaller file sizes compared to Excel
- Easier to version control in git repositories

### 3. **Improved User Experience**:
- Users can create budget files in their preferred application
- Faster file processing (CSV parsing is more efficient than Excel)
- Better error messages for CSV-specific issues

## Sample CSV Format

The system now includes a sample CSV file (`sample_budget_data.csv`) that demonstrates the expected format:

```csv
Category Name,Description,Allocated Amount
Infrastructure,Roads and bridges construction,50000000
Healthcare,Medical facilities and equipment,30000000
Education,Schools and educational programs,25000000
Public Safety,Police and emergency services,20000000
Transportation,Public transit and road maintenance,18000000
```

## Backward Compatibility

- **Excel Support Maintained**: All existing Excel functionality continues to work
- **Same Data Structure**: Both formats use identical column layouts
- **Unified Processing**: Single upload method handles both formats seamlessly
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing users can continue using Excel files

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- CSV files are correctly parsed and processed
- Excel files continue to work as before
- File type detection works correctly
- Error handling provides meaningful feedback
- Data validation works for both formats

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. **Additional CSV Formats**: Support for different delimiters (semicolon, tab)
2. **Bulk Operations**: Process multiple files at once
3. **Template Downloads**: Provide downloadable CSV templates
4. **Advanced Validation**: More sophisticated data validation rules
5. **Preview Mode**: Show parsed data before final upload

## Conclusion

The CSV upload implementation successfully transforms the budget management system from Excel-only to a flexible, multi-format solution. Users now have the choice between CSV and Excel files, with CSV being the recommended format for its simplicity and compatibility. The system maintains all existing functionality while adding significant new capabilities.
